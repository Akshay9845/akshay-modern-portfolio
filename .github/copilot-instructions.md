## Project Overview
This is a modern Next.js portfolio website built with cutting-edge technologies:
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Three.js** with React Three Fiber for 3D graphics
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **React Three Drei** for 3D helpers and controls

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Follow clean code principles

## 3D & Animation Guidelines
- Use React Three Fiber for 3D scenes
- Implement smooth Framer Motion animations
- Optimize 3D performance with proper LOD and culling
- Use Suspense for 3D component loading
- Implement proper lighting and materials

## Component Structure
- Create reusable UI components in `@/components/ui/`
- Place 3D components in `@/components/3d/`
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries for 3D components

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper 3D scene optimization
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
